Objective of Day 2: Increase familiarity and experience with OpenAI API and demonstrate other uses beyond basic chatbot functions

What You Need: OpenAI library installed, Editor that supports openai (VS Code, Replit, etc.), and an API key

What will you create: A basic guessing game modeled around the popular game 20 questions. In this case, the user will provide the word to guess, and the AI will guess the word.

HOMEWORK: Make the inverse of the game where the AI generates a word based off a topic the user has given, and the player guesses what it is
